Amazon Web Services is a platform that provides several companies with Operations infrastructure. By handling the infrastructure management, capacity management and scalability issues AWS abstracts away the Operations from the company in a secure and reliable manner. <br />
For this homework we learned about the EC2 service provided by AWS. This the service that provides what is commonly known as virtualization. It enables users to create and manage virtual machines to suit their needs. The greatest advantage of virtualization is that companies can do away with the costs associated with physical infrastructure. The added advantage of the virtual nature of the deployment is that we can clone the contents of the deployment at any point of time and not suffer any downtime in case of VM failure.
